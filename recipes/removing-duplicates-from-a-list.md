## Problem
You have a list and you want to remove any duplicated elements from the list and the order should not change.
The solution can use the `equal?` function or use the comparison function as an argument.

## Usage
```
(remove-duplicates '(1 2 3 1 2 4 4 5 6 7 5))
;; ==> '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
```
