## Why new Cookbook?

The project contain old cookbook resurected from Archive.org but the licenses
is unclear what are requirement if somone use single recipe in his own code.
The old cookbooks is also pretty outdated.

We want modern R7RS solution of possible with note about solution that use any SRFI
