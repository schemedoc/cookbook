# Scheme Cookbook

This project aims to create a new and improved cookbook for the Scheme
programming language.

If you want to contribute, just [create a new
issue](https://github.com/schemedoc/cookbook/issues/new/choose) using
the _Recipe_ template.

You can contribute by:

* Describing a common problem as a question.
* Posting both a problem and a solution.

You can also comment on the existing problems and solutions.

## Why a new cookbook?

We started by resurrecting the Schematics Scheme Cookbook from
Archive.org. However, the license is unclear and we could not reach
anyone among the original authors who could explain it to us. The
cookbook is also pretty outdated at this point.

The new cookbook should emphasize modern R7RS and R6RS solutions and
use SRFIs for things that are not covered by the standard. However,
other solutions are also accepted.
