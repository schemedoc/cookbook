Pattern matching is a particular convenient way to specify
a case analysis on compound data and at the same time to
deconstruct the data.
<p />
The essence of pattern matching is to compare the input data with
set of patterns and when the first matching pattern is found,
to perform an associated action. A typical match expression
has the following form:
<p />
<div class="scheme">
  <pre>(<span class="variable">match</span> <span class="variable">&lt;expression&gt;</span>
  (<span class="variable">&lt;pattern_1&gt;</span> <span class="variable">&lt;expression_1&gt;</span>)
  ...)
</pre>
</div>
<p />
The result of &lt;expression&gt; is compared to the patterns &lt;pattern1&gt; ...
in turn, until the first matching pattern is found, then the
associated &lt;expression_n&gt; is evaluated. If the pattern &lt;pattern_n&gt;
contains pattern variables used to match arbitrary input, then
these variables in &lt;expression_n&gt; are bound to the pieces of
matched. Example: If the datum (1 2) is matched by the pattern (a b),
then an associated expression (+ a b) will evaluate to 3.
<p />
There are several pattern matching libraries for Scheme. PLT Scheme
comes with two, namely (lib "match.ss" "mzlib") and (lib "plt-match.ss" "mzlib").
The most important difference between them is pattern syntax, where plt-match
is open to future enchancements.
<p />
You can view pattern matching as being similar to regular expressions,
but acting on S-expressions instead of text strings.  As in Regular Expressions,
patterns allow you to bind parts of the data to variables that can be used in
the <code>expression</code> part.   Unlike regular expression systems, patterns can
be used to do things like
<p />
<ol>
<li> Match against the fields of a <code>struct</code>.
</li>
<li> Match based on the result of evaluating an expression.
</li>
<li> Use quasiquoting to make pattern templates.
</li>
</ol>
<p />
Pattern matching is useful in handling markup (HTML or XML translated to S-Expressions),
dispatching functions, and analyzing Scheme code, among other tasks.
