<p />
There is a bug in IE which ruins the layout of receipes containing code with very long lines. An example is: <a href="/Cookbook/AligningStrings">AligningStrings</a>.  Previously I have just wrapped the offending lines, but since not all of you use IE I'd just make you aware of the problem. I think the problem is the interpretation of CSS.

The problem does seem to be CSS-related.  It seems to occur anytime that the source code lines are wider than the browser window, in IE.  It works fine in Mozilla-family browsers.
<p />
The <a href="/Main/VoidSkin">VoidSkin</a> which the site currently uses has some fairly sophisticated CSS to achieve the page layout.  The CSS files are:
<p />
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://schematics.appsolutions.com/twiki/pub/TWiki/VoidSkin/voidsizefixed.css" target="_top">voidsizefixed.css</a>
</li>
<li> <a href="http://schematics.appsolutions.com/twiki/pub/TWiki/VoidSkin/bluevoid.css" target="_top">bluevoid.css</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p />
Fixing this will probably require trial and error, especially to ensure it doesn't also break in other browsers.  Other alternatives are to switch to a different skin, or change VoidSkin's CSS to use tables instead of CSS, which might work better.
<p />
I did some playing around with an aspect of this problem in <a href="/Sandbox/TestVerbatim">TestVerbatim</a>.  It seems that fiddling with the DIV and PRE elements in which Scheme source is currently wrapped has an effect on the problem, although it's flaky.
