A string is a sequence of characters. A string is written
by enclosing the characters with a doublequote ("). Some
special characters must be preceded by a backslash, these
include doublequote and backslash. The technique of marking
special characters are called <code>escaping</code> and backslash it self
is called an <code>escape character</code>.
<p />
Examples of literal strings:
500 Can't connect to 127.0.0.1:8778 (connect: Connection refused)
<p />
<p />
In Scheme, strings are sequences of characters.  Since you can't talk about strings without talking about characters, you should know that mzScheme versions prior to 299 support the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf" target="_top">Basic Latin</a> and <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf" target="_top">Latin-1 Supplement</a>, AKA ISO-8859-1.  Version 299 and above supports the full Unicode character set, using UTF-8 as the internal representation.
<p />
You can specify a literal character with the sequence #\ followed by the character, i.e.
500 Can't connect to 127.0.0.1:8778 (connect: Connection refused)
<p />
Character literals can also be represented by #\u followed by a hex number:
500 Can't connect to 127.0.0.1:8778 (connect: Connection refused)
<p />
You can convert between characters and integers using the <code>char-&gt;integer</code> and <code>integer-&gt;char</code> functions:
500 Can't connect to 127.0.0.1:8778 (connect: Connection refused)
