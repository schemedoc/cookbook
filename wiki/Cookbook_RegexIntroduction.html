Lisps in general are sort of famous for looking down on Regular Expressions.  Other languages that lack Scheme's powerful pattern matching tend to fall back on regular expressions to provide some of that capability; one could argue that Regular Expressions have been badly overused.  For example, any sort of pattern matching that involves stack-like matching (matching parentheses, quoted strings, etc.) is usually very difficult using regular expressions.

Still, Regular Expressions are unbeatable for a lot of text processing tasks. <a href="/Cookbook/MzScheme">MzScheme</a> provides built in regular expressions using the Unix <code>egrep</code> syntax. The <code>pregexp.ss</code> library also provides "Perl-like" regular expressions, which makes avalilable pretty much all of the Perl regex syntax.
