  <a href="/Cookbook/TeachScheme">TeachScheme</a> is a program that teaches high-school teachers to teach Scheme.  To quote from their Web site:
<p />
<blockquote>The <a href="/Cookbook/TeachScheme">TeachScheme</a>! Project wants to turn Computing and Programming into an indispensable part of the liberal arts curriculum. Computing and Programming teach skills just as fundamental as, and closely related to, essay writing in English and problem solving in mathematics. Students who learn to design programs properly learn to analyze a problem statement; express its essence, abstractly and with examples; formulate statements and comments in a precise language; evaluate and revise these activities in light of checks and tests; and pay attention to details. This benefits all students, not just those who wish to study computing. For students who want to pursue other disciplines, this curriculum shows how they can use computing to model the phenomena they will encounter elsewhere.</blockquote>
