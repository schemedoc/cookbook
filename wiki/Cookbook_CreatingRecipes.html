Use the <a href="/Cookbook/NewRecipe">NewRecipe</a> page (accessible from the bar on the left in the <a href="/Main/VoidSkin">VoidSkin</a>) to quickly create a recipe using the standard template.
<p />
A recipe consists of five main sections:
<p />
<ol>
<li> The problem definition concisely presents the problem
</li>
<li> The solution presents the preferred solution
</li>
<li> The discussion discusses tradeoffs inherent in the solution and other possible solutions
</li>
<li> See Also references other related recipes
</li>
<li> Comments are material that isn't directly relevant to the recipe.  Often they discuss meta issues.
</li>
</ol>

<p />
There are two main reasons for creating recipes:
<p />
<ul>
<li> You have a problem you would like help with.  Make sure you specify at least the problem statement in the recipe and set the <a href="/Cookbook/TopicType">TopicType</a> as <a href="/Cookbook/RecipeStub">RecipeStub</a>.  If you create a recipe for this reason you should try to make the problem as general as possible so other people can benefit from it.  If you make the problem very specific don't be surprised if the problem statement is changed.
</li>
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> You have knowledge you wish to share.  In this case you'll probably fill in at least the problem and solution, and perhaps the discussion
</li>
</ul>

If there are two very different solutions, and neither is superior in the general case, can they both be documented in the Solution section.  I think the two-solutions situation often arises when the Problem statement is general enough that more information is needed before the best general-case solution can be determined.  But making two seperate topics to distinguish the two problems might confuse the user who conceptualizes his/her problem more vaguely.  Making two separate topics also means that some background material they share in common might want to be moved elsewhere.  Perhaps there could be subheadings under Solution, or "Solution #1" and "Solution #2" headings, rather than relegating all but one solution to the "Discussion" section?
