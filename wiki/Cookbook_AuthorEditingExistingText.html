<p />
There are many different types of editing, from fixing typos through adding comments
to wholescale restructuring of pages.  Always think about the value of your edit to the reader.  A comment tacked on to the end of topic forces the reader to read the whole topic and then integrate your comment into the main body of the text.  Far better is to do the work for them and make your changes to the main text.  Don't be afraid of offending people by making changes to their text.  It is in the <span style="background : #FFFFCE;">
  <font color="#0000FF">WikiNature</font>
</span><a href="/edit/Cookbook/WikiNature?topicparent=Cookbook.AuthorEditingExistingText">?</a> to freely edit text and authors expect their text to be edited.  As TWiki has revision control no content is ever lost so you should never be afraid of making even major changes.  If you do completely  restructure a topic is may help to leave a note explaining why you made the changes you did.
<p />
Some conventions we've adopted:
<p />
<ul>
<li> If you make a major change to the body of a recipe, and would like credit for it, add your signature to the list of signatures at the bottom of the page
</li>
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> If others have added their signatures, leave them there
</li>
</ul>
