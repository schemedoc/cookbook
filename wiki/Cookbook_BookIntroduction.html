The Scheme Cookbook's primary aim is show how common programming problems can be solved in Scheme via short programming "recipes".  Parts of the Cookbook are specific to <a href="/Cookbook/PltScheme">PLT Scheme</a> but we aim to provide portable solutions when possible (see <a href="/Cookbook/BeingPltSpecific">BeingPltSpecific</a>).
<p />
A secondary aim of the Cookbook is to further the adoption of Scheme.  To that end we  want to allow the possibility of a publishable book.  The <a href="/Cookbook/ContributorAgreement">ContributorAgreement</a> statement for this book is the most important consideration for publication.  It is designed to allow free access to the content of the Cookbook while protecting the investmest a publisher may make in a compilation of material from the Cookbook.  If you are going to contribute to the Cookbook you must agree to the <a href="/Cookbook/ContributorAgreement">ContributorAgreement</a> statement.
<p />
Given the current lack of practical documentation for Scheme we also aim to cover areas of practical programming that fall outside the strict Cookbook remit.  This includes topics such as:
<p />
<ul>
<li> <a href="/Cookbook/IdiomChapter">Scheme idioms</a>
</li>
<li> <a href="/Cookbook/PearlsChapter">Programming pearls</a>
</li>
<li> <a href="/Cookbook/LibraryIndex">Scheme code libraries</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p />
The Cookbook is a collaborative document and contributions are actively sought from all users of Scheme.  See the <a href="/Cookbook/AuthorChapter">AuthorChapter</a> for instructions on how you can contribute.
