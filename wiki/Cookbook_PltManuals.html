<p />
<a href="/Cookbook/PltScheme">PLT Scheme</a> is well-documented, with a plethora of manuals in HTML format.  Many of the most frequently asked questions about PLT Scheme can be answered by using the <a href="/Cookbook/HelpDesk">Help Desk</a> to do a keyword search of the manuals.
<p />
Some of these manuals are included as part of the basic installation of PLT Scheme, and others can be installed via the Help Desk.  In addition to the Help Desk, manuals can also be viewed by visiting <a href="http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/" target="_top">http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/</a> in any Web browser.  Emacs users can also view manuals by using the <a href="/Cookbook/Quack">Quack</a> menu or <code>quack-view-manual</code> command.
<p />
The complete documentation of the current version is available at [http://docs.plt-scheme.org/ docs.plt-scheme.org], including a search function. This documentation has been written using the Scribble documentation tool which is part of PLT and can be used by Scheme programmrs to document their own tools in the same, convenient way.
